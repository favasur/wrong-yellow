## Latest — `7ffa2c4` (tag: `v0.1.12-0.5.6`) — Rename blocks with Cloth_ prefix

### Bulk rename: `Block_Wool_Yellow_*` → `Cloth_Block_Wool_Yellow_*`
- Renamed all 6 wool block JSON files to prefix with `Cloth_`:
  - `Block_Wool_Yellow.json` → `Cloth_Block_Wool_Yellow.json`
  - `Block_Wool_Yellow_Light.json` → `Cloth_Block_Wool_Yellow_Light.json`
  - `Block_Wool_Yellow_Half.json` → `Cloth_Block_Wool_Yellow_Half.json`
  - `Block_Wool_Yellow_Light_Half.json` → `Cloth_Block_Wool_Yellow_Light_Half.json`
  - `Block_Wool_Yellow_Stairs.json` → `Cloth_Block_Wool_Yellow_Stairs.json`
  - `Block_Wool_Yellow_Light_Stairs.json` → `Cloth_Block_Wool_Yellow_Light_Stairs.json`
- Updated all internal translation keys (`items.block_wool_yellow_*` → `items.cloth_block_wool_yellow_*`)
- Updated icon and texture PNG references to `Cloth_Block_Wool_Yellow_*`
- Renamed all 8 corresponding PNG files (4 BlockTextures + 4 Icons)
- Updated all language file entries

### Previous: Fix halfblock vertical wall placement
- Added missing `PlacementSettings.RotationMode: "StairFacingPlayer"` to both halfblock files
  - This was accidentally removed in commit `58875f9` when `VariantRotation` was changed to `UpDownNESW`
  - Without it, halfblocks couldn't be placed vertically against walls

## `acbd176` — Refactor flickering onto vanilla block with proper OFF variant

### Repo rename
- GitHub repository renamed from `wrong-yellow` → `backrooms-hytale`
- Local root folder renamed to match
- All URLs and references updated in README, changelog
- Git remote URL updated to `https://github.com/favasur/backrooms-hytale.git`

### Big refactor: Custom blocks → Vanilla override
- Removed all 3 custom `Block_White_Build_Lightsource` variants (ON/Flickering/Off)
- Created vanilla `Build_Lightsource_White` override at `Build/Lightsource/` with:
  - `AmbientSoundEventId: "Backrooms_Light_Buzz"` for looping buzz sound
  - `Light.Radius: 15` for actual world light emission
- Created `Block_Lightsource_White_Off` as OFF variant (same vanilla texture, no light, no sound)
- Flickering now works on the **vanilla** lightsource block — no custom block needed

### Flickering timing rebalance
- Flicker burst chance: **50% → 12%** (much rarer)
- Rest period between bursts: **0.5-1s → 2-6s**
- Initial delay before first flicker: **0.25-1s → 1.5-4.5s**
- Rapid cycling during bursts kept the same (1-4 ticks per state)
- `BLOCK_OFF` changed from `Build_Black_Cube` → `Block_Lightsource_White_Off`

### Sound fixes
- Sound events restored at `Server/Audio/SoundEvents/` (correct path the game scans)
- Removed old test path `Server/soundevent/`
- Added `AudioCategory: AudioCat_Ambient` back to both sound events
- Changed `Volume` from `0` back to `0.0` (matching original working format)
- Lightsource and Caveman Cutout now emit their looping ambient sounds correctly

### Texture fixes
- Panel_2Tall and Panel_3Tall blockymodels:
  - `doubleSided: true → false` (single layer rendering)
  - Back face offset matches front face offset (was using different atlas region)
  - Right/left face offsets changed to `x=0` (solid color, prevents texture bleeding)

## `2c7a211` — Fix Caveman/Stop Sign collision

- **Block_Caveman_Cutout.json**, **Block_Stop_Sign.json**
  - Removed `Material: Solid` field entirely (following base game plant block pattern)
  - Changed `HitboxType` from `None` -> `Plant_Tall_Full` (valid 2-block-tall plant hitbox)
  - Removes collision by mimicking how plant blocks handle it

---

## `b65d4d0` — Major rework: Flickering, sound, panels

### New flickering variant block
- Created Block_White_Build_Lightsource_Flickering.json with buzz sound
- Deleted Block_White_Build_Lightsource_Dimmed.json (ON/OFF only now)

### Rewritten flickering logic
- FlickeringTickingSystem.java: ON/OFF only, rapid cycling, 50% flicker start chance
- Buzz sound flickers naturally with block swaps

### Double-layer texture fix
- Panel_2Tall.blockymodel, Panel_3Tall.blockymodel: doubleSided false

### Sound fix
- Block_White_Build_Lightsource.json: restored buzz sound on FULL variant only
